## Getting Started
To access the portal, use one of the following user accounts when prompted for login. The `admin` user has been granted privileged rights for [Admin Management](#Admin%20Management), and contains several scan history for ease of access. To build a scan from scratch, use the `user` account instead.

| Username | Password | Role          |
|:--------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
| admin    | admin    | Administrator |
| user     | user     | Default User  |

## Scan
All created and completed scans can be found in the **Scan Dashboard** under the **Scan** tab. Scans are sorted in descending order based on the latest update time. Every scan can have multiple simulations, and within each simulations are several layers of techniques/variants/objectives chained together.

### Creating Scan
1. On the Scan Dashboard, click on <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%2B%20%20Create%20Scan-%2371c6dd">
2. Enter details for the Windows 10 target machine:
    * **IP Address**: Ensure that the target machine has Internet connection to download payloads from the repo.
    * **Username**: Use a Local Administrator account to enable Interactive Logon session. 
    * **Password**: User credentials for authentication.
3. Select <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20Create%20Scan-%2371c6dd">

### Adding Simulation
1. On the bottom of an existing scan, click on <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20Add%20Simulation-%23696d97">
2. Modify the newly added simulation by clicking the ðŸ–Š button:
    * **Simulation Name**: Provide a new simulation name.
    * **Add Attacker Objective**: Select a technique from the library.
3. Select <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20Update%20Simulation-%2371c6dd">

### Editing Simulation
1. Expand the offcanvas by clicking on the objective box.
2. Modify the technique by clicking the ðŸ–Š button beside of **SIMULATION DETAILS**:
    * **Payload**: Main payload for threat simulation. Please include `.exe` as the extension for LOLBins for globufscation to work.
    * (Optional) **Cleanup**: Command to wipe leftover artificats. Also used as verification to lower false positive rate. Optional but highly encouraged to include. 
    * (Optional) **Chain To Previous**: When enabled, the current technique will execute if the previous one succedeed. Disabled by default, only enable if the payload has dependencies from the previous technique.
    * (Optional) **High Integrity Process**: Run the payload under High Integrity context. Disabled by default, only enable for privileged actions such as Credentials Dumping and Process Injection.
3. Select <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20Update%20Details-%2371c6dd">

### Launching Scan
1. The current status must be one of the following for a scan to initiate:
    * **STOPPED**: Scanning is halted and results for all simulations are reset to NULL.
    * **COMPLETED**: Scanning is completed and results are displayed on the objective box.
    * **ERROR**: Scanning halted due to ConnectionError, TimeoutError or CredentialsError.
2. To start the scan, click on the status display-bar located on the top-right corner.

### Terminating Scan
1. To terminate a scan in-progress, the status must be **RUNNING**:
    * **RUNNING**: Scanning in progress, results are updated in real-time. Refresh required.
2. Click on the status display-bar located on the top-right corner, and the scan will be halted automatically on the next interval.

## Template
Scan templates are granular configuration settings specified by the user. It is essentially a snapshot of all the simulations and techniques contained in a scan at the time of cloning. This allows user to replicate scans easily and make changes to existing scans without compromising the original backup.

### Template Types
There are mainly 3 types of Scan Templates:
* **APT**: Specialized templates that simulates the attack chain of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. Accessible by everyone, but only Administrators can create or modify such template.
* **Community**: Public templates that are shared among all users. Accessible by everyone and can be published by anyone, but only the template owner has Edit permission.
* **Private**: Private templates that are only accessible by the owner. Acts as a backup for scans.

### Cloning Scan
1. On the **Templates** tab, select one of the template types and click **ADD**.
2. Select one of the existing scans to clone from.
3. Click <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20Create%20Template-%2371c6dd">

### Mobilizing Template
1. On the top right of a template, click on <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%2B%20%20Simulate%20Now-%2371c6dd">
2. Enter details for the Windows 10 target machine:
    * **IP Address**: Ensure that the target machine has Internet connection to download payloads from the repo.
    * **Username**: Use a Local Administrator account to enable Interactive Logon session. 
    * **Password**: User credentials for authentication.
3. Select <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%20Create%20Scan-%2371c6dd">

## Library
The threat library consisting of **24 Unique LOLBins** and **49 Variants** is accessible publicly for browsing, but can only be modified by an Administrator. The built-in search bar allows user to query techniques based on attributes like **Binary Name**, **Objectives** and **APT Groups**.

### Adding Technique
1. On the **Library** tab, click on <img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-%2B%20%20Create%20Technique-%2371c6dd">
2. Enter details for the new technique/binary, these attributes will affect how the technique appear in the search bar:
    * **Objectives**: Select one or more than one execution purpose.
    * **(Optional) APT Groups**: Select any APT groups based on the prevelance of usage and adoption.

### Adding Variant
1.
